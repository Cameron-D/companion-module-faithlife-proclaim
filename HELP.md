## Important Note on Remote Access

Proclaim currently only supports the control API from the same computer that Proclaim is running on -- no remote access is permitted.

If Companion is not running on the same computer, a proxy is currently required, a simple one is available from [Cameron-D/proclaim-proxy](https://github.com/Cameron-D/proclaim-proxy)
